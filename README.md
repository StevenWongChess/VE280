#### Hi, wc to VE280, Programming & Elem. Data Structures.

##### Introduction

Feeling this course useful, I redo all the lab assignments and project in year 2021. All these are written by C++ using flag -std=c++11. 

##### Reading Order

1. My suggestion would be first go to ```./Lecture Slides``` and take one week's time to understand all the concepts inside. 
2. Then go to ```./Five Projects``` and spend 2 days on each of the programming assignments. From my experience, it might **take more time** on the third and fourth projects, especially for debugging and testing. 
3. Before going into the ```./Useful Recitation Class```, it is better to spend one day to review the Lecture Slides. 
4. The RC slides contains **much much much more** contents than VE280 itself. On reviewing the recitation class slides, I am shocked by the countless amount of knowledge owned by the TAs. Great thanks to the whole TA group for bring us some big pictures and intro to other advanced topics.
5. If you are students taking this course later than year 2019, you are lucky because you have new projects and labs to practice. Pls refer to [this link](https://github.com/tc-imba/VE280) for description and starter files of the new projects. Pls refer to [this link](https://github.com/LouieBHLu/VE280_2020_Summer/tree/master/Labs) for description and starter files of the new labs.

##### More on RC

In one word, old RC classes for knowledges and new RC/labs for practice.
